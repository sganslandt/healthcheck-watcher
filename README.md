An attempt to build a simple aggregation and visualisation of the combined health of a cluster of services exposing 
dropwizard healthchecks kind of healthchecks. 

Let your service discovery system add and remove services to the healthchecks watcher as services become available and 
die off, and healthchecks-watcher will give an aggregated view of your whole cluster and single endpoint to monitor 
for partial failures, with directions about where to go for deeper investigations. 

Not even sure if this makes sense yet, we'll see when it reaches production : ). Welcome to contribute with feature 
requests, input on existing issues and pull requests for features or bug fixes.
